# ReactDifficulty
React Difficulty Picker Application



A basic React.JS project to choose the difficulty in React.
The Difficulties are set to Low, Medium, High and Insane.
Based on the difficulty you choose it will be displayed as Difficulty set to Low/Medium/High/Insane.
We can still develop it a lot, like based on the difficulty we can suggest the user some online resources where he can skill up in React and a lot more.
